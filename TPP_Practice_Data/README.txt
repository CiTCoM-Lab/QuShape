This folder contains the data files and instructions for performing a full QuShape analysis on the TPP riboswitch.

Instructions for analyzing the data are contained in the TPP_QuShape_Analysis.pdf file.

* TPP_riboswitch_seq.txt: Official sequence file for TPP Riboswitch RNA

* TPP_+1M7.fsa: The raw (+) reagent data that have not been processed in any way. The second column is (+) Reagent, the third column is ddC sequencing. 

* TPP_DMSO.fsa: The raw (-) reagent data that have not been processed in any way. The second column is (-) Reagent, the third column is ddC sequencing. 

* test1001_done.qushape: A file showing the final, correct results for this analysis.
